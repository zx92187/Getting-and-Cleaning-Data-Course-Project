# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

#### This Repo is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following: 

1. Downloading and Unziping the Dataset.
2. Loading activity labels and features.
3. Loading both the training and test datasets, extracting only the data on mean and standard deviation (Std).
4. Loading the activity and subject datya for each dataset, and merging those columns with the dataset. 
5. Merging two datasets and adding labels. 
6. Changing the activity and subject columns into factors. 
7. Creates a tidy dataset that has the mean value of each variable for each activity pair and subject. 

In the end, the results is in the file tidy dataset.txt.

Thank you very much for reviewing.
